# Project 2 Ideas!

Your second Project will be your first foray into building a full-stack application, from scratch, on your own.

Project 2 is really exciting! It can also, by nature, sound a bit overwhelming.

We want to see you succeed! So over this weekend, we want you to come up with some ideas for your Project 2. 

**We will be looking for 3 project ideas, turned in via pull request to this repository, that illustrate a rough concept of what you might do for your project 2!**

## Technical Requirements for P2:
 [Link to Specs](https://gawdiseattle.gitbook.io/wdi/11-projects/project-2)

Your app must:
- Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) that represents the main functional idea for your app. This doesn't include join tables or the user model which should be part of your class's boilerplate code.

> Note: If your app idea doesn't really call for more models, let your instructors know and they can suggest ideas for other sufficiently difficult replacements for this requirement.

- Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
- Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape. Maybe grab an API from this [list of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
- Include a readme file that explains how to use your app
- Have semantically clean HTML, CSS, and back-end code
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public
